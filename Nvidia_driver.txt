problem with CUDA samples using third-party packages

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22360771/missing-recommended-library-libglu-so

After you do the installation of the above 3rd party libraries, no harm running the NVIDIA driver installation again if you encounter something like this:

/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.8.2/../../../libGL.so when searching for -lGL/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /lib/libGL.so when searching for -lGL
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libGL.so when searching for -lGL
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lGL
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [simpleGL] Error 1

This is because some of the symbolic links were broken by the installation.

resolve LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Solved. Finally I did:

sudo echo "/usr/local/cuda-7.0/lib64" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf
sudo ldconfig

after update which installed a new kernel, can't boot, freeze on "loading initramfs ..."

[SOLVED] Just reinstall NVIDIA driver, the version I used is 352.39 (based on the first link while installing cuda)
         remember to enable DKMS during the install

Step1:

I think the first thing you need to do is remove all installs of nvidia-drivers and related packages
Code:
sudo apt-get purge nvidia*
remove all the ppa's you added to try to resolve this issue eg
Code:
sudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers
remove the current xorg.conf (if you have one)
Code:
sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.2015-12-28
You should now have a clean slate, so add the Graphics Drivers Team ppa
Code:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
Update the system
Code:
sudo apt-get update
Make sure you have the latest source and headers
Code:
sudo apt-get install linux-source linux-headers-generic
Install either nvidia-355 or nvidia-358 - I'm using 358, but there is a warning on the PPA page that 358 reportedly crashes Steam and they advise 355 - decide for yourself
Code:
sudo apt-get install nvidia-35x nvidia-settings
DO NOT RESTART

Step2:

You'll need to edit /etc/default/grub at Lines 11 and 25 (use sudo nano)
Code:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset"
Code:
GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080
After editing you'll need to
Code:
sudo update-grub2

Step3:
